                The App provides a platform for the Services by allowing a Hirer to post or communicate a job role, which can be viewed by Referrers. Referrers
                and Hirers are able to communicate via the App in relation to any job roles and Referrals. A Referral Fee will be payable by the Hirer to the
                Referrer for any Successful Referral. The Hirer will set the level of the Referral Fee when posting the job opportunity, and a Referrer will be
                considered to have accepted the terms of that Referral Fee when making a Referral.

                Nudj acts solely as a facilitator to connect Users. This means, for example, that Nudj does not vet the credentials of Candidates or Referrers,
                nor does it have any involvement in the decisions made by Users during the referral process. Users are responsible for their own conduct when
                using the Services. In addition, Hirers and Referrers both have important obligations to ensure the effective operation of the Services, which
                are set out below.

    <li>
        <p>
            where the Hirer continues to pursue a Candidate referred to it after any initial conversation with that Candidate, it will notify the relevant
            Referrer within 2 days of making the further contact.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>

            sound judgment is exercised when considering a potential Candidate and when making any Referral, so that the Candidate is only Referred if the

                in respect of which the Referral was made in the preceding 3 months prior to any purported Referral (and the Hirer can provide documentary
                evidence of the Hirer’s awareness of the Candidate in relation to that role) (an “Existing Referral”), the Hirer shall notify the Referrer that
                the Candidate is an Existing Referral within 10 working days of the date of the Referral by the Referrer (“Notification Deadline”) and no
                Referral Fee shall be payable in respect of such Referral by the Referrer. In the event that no notification is provided by the Hirer on or
                before the Notification Deadline, no Existing Referral shall be deemed to exist and the Hirer shall be obliged to pay the Referral Fee to the
                Referrer on the occurrence of a Successful Referral.

                Hirers should note that non-payment of a Referral Fee will constitute a material breach of the EULA, entitling Nudj, at its option to (i)
                suspend the Hirer’s use of the Services and the App until such Referral Fee has been paid in full, and / or (ii) block the Hirer from using the
                Services and the App.
