### PUT api/v1/users/verify

Context: When a user downloads the app, they provide (manually) their phone number. A record is created in the database for that phone number, a four digit pin is generated that is saved against the phone number, and the four digit pin is sent by sms to the phone number. 

Then if/when a `verify` call is made that contains both the phone number and the correct pin, the user record is set to "verified".

Description: Performs the step of verifying a user.
